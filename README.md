# Ubuntu_OPCD_Tools
The OPCD Tools for build GSPro golf courses on Ubuntu (Kubuntu).

This is a collection of tools to help GSPro golf course designers get started on Ubuntu (Kubuntu).   Most GSPro course design work is built using Windows and downloading many utilities to step through the process.   You will find one document caled LIDAR to TERRAIN - Free Process which is incredibly helpful, but I found something where ackward and and unclear.    All the tools needed are available for Linux natively, or via Wine64.   They all have big learning curves and it's easy to get confused as to what is each step in the process needs.   So programs needed are:

QGIS (Ubuntu Linux native works with 24.10)
GDAL tools  (Ubuntu Linux native). 
CloudCompare (Ubuntu Linux native).
Unity 2018.2.8f1  (Linux native).
Inkscape  (Linux Native).
GreenKeeper (Runs under Wine64).
GSPro Keyboard for course developers probably runs under Wine64 like GreenKeeper.

In addition you will want to get Join the "Zeros and Ones Golf Course Design" group on Discord.   There will find a great discussions, but some tools that are helpful.   For example on topic are is called #lidar-to-terrain-free-processes, which is a great starting point.   There you will find to items of interest, and "Howto" document LIDAR_to_TERRAIN_Free_Process.pdf and some other useful tools like "QGIS_Support_Files.zip"   The zip file contains a number of .bat files for 
helping create your heightmaps from lidar.  I've rewritten these and converted them to shell commands to make it easier for the linux people.

In the coming days, I will be uploading these tool, a file installer.
